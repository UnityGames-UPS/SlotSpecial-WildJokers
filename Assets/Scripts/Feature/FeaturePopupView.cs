/// The feature popup shared by all three features (BonusFreeSpins.md §8): a backdrop that rotates
/// clockwise, a frame, and one child per message, of which exactly one is shown.
///
/// This object holds the script and stays on. The popup itself is popupGroup (PopupImage in the
/// scene): its CanvasGroup fades it, and it is what is switched on and off. The backdrop and the
/// frame under it are switched on whenever it opens, so the scene can be saved with any of them off.
///
/// Free Spins uses MYSTERY RESPIN, CONGRATULATIONS (with the awarded spin count) and TOTAL WIN (counted
/// up, taken down at TAKE). Sandbell Pick uses MYSTERY RESPIN, its own CONGRATULATIONS and TOTAL WIN
/// (taken down on its own). The Ball's CONGRATULATIONS child is wired when that feature is built.
///
/// View layer only: GameManager calls in and is called back when a message has gone. Everything is
/// DOTween-driven. Every reference is optional — a missing message still calls back, so a round
/// never stalls on it.
